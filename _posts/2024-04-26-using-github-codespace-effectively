# Introduction
Often times when training a machine learning model I end up having to use either google colab or kaggle. The reason for this is because my flimsy laptop might not be cut out for the job or if it does, it will take a ridiculous amount of time. Absolutely unnaceptable!

They also say beauty lies in the eyes of the beholder but I believe the way I have setup my code editor looks very pretty(like any developer does). In light of this I might not want to give up my local development environment for a cloud based one. 

Enter github and azure workspaces 

# Github Codespace 
A codespace is a development environment that's hosted in the cloud. You can customize your project for GitHub Codespaces by committing configuration files to your repository (often known as Configuration-as-Code), which creates a repeatable codespace configuration for all users of your project.

You can connect to your codespaces from your browser, from Visual Studio Code, from the JetBrains Gateway application, or by using GitHub CLI. When you connect, you are placed within the Docker container. You have limited access to the outer Linux virtual machine host.

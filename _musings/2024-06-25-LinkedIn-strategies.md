# Building a comprehensive LinkedIn company profile 
## Overview of LinkedIn as a marketing platform.
Humans have the urge to communicate with other humans in group settings, as is evidenced by all the “need to belong” studies done by various researchers. This “need to belong” and the emergence of technology gave birth to a class of modern applications called *Social Networks*. Many social networks serve different purposes, we will specifically look into LinkedIn. LinkedIn is a popular social network that serves a particular purpose, while other social networks like Twitter and Facebook focus on your personal life, LinkedIn is used for *professional networking*. Professional Networking is all about building a group of contacts to help advance your career. It is a strategy also employed by recruiters and employers when looking for suitable candidates and screening prospective candidates. 

LinkedIn has many modules that serve different people and their needs. To build your network, you can add contacts (also known as connections) with other LinkedIn users. As you make connections, you’ll be able to get skill endorsements, ask for recommendations, and find new job opportunities.
You can also join groups focused on various companies, industries, and occupations. Groups can keep you up to date on the latest news in your field, as well as help you find others who share your professional interests. 
The primary use of LinkedIn by software development companies is in marketing which we shall analyze in the next chapters 

## Key marketing strategies
The Core goal of any marketing campaign is to ensure a continuous flow of clients and customers. Software development companies in particular need a wide market reach to get more clients, this speaks for itself when the products the company churns out are products in demand by the consumers a classic corollary of the statement *“Do one thing and do it well” ~ Jan Koum*. 

Common marketing strategies include: 
### Optimizing Profile pages
They say the devil is in the details, I say the client is a very picky demon(sometimes). The average customer will start looking for a potential service provider with a very vaguely written project scope and a solid idea on paper. While scouting on LinkedIn they will openly discredit any companies with a shady profile. the way to improve a profile is by posting engaging content regularly and encouraging employees to follow and share from the page. These practices all add up to a popular tenet in modern search engines; Search engine Optimization which works by optimizing search rankings and increasing visibility.
### Utilizing LinkedIn Inbuilt Targeting Systems
Let's face it, in the modern age even with perfect operational security, There is always going to be your digital footprint on the internet because people you interact with have barely any understanding of the consequences of their actions by liking that post on `#RejectFinanceBill2024` and tagging you on the same post. In short, building a digital persona for most people on these social networks is a very simple task for the managers of the social networks, for proof look no further than the Cambridge Analytica scandal, where Facebook quite literally swayed the voting population. 
Linkedin has inbuilt targeting systems that can direct ads and marketing campaigns to the relevant consumers This is because the platform offers the right mix of data-driven, reliable, and authoritative content to the users. 
#### Accurate and Niche-Specific Targeting
LinkedIn is a goldmine for people to target their audience and all the data comes straight from valued members. The precise, actionable, and niche-specific data are a boon for companies trying to put their content in front of their audience. 

Account targeting is a unique approach to targeting your preferred clients. Simply, use the search bar on your LinkedIn homepage by typing the name of your target audience. For example, if you are looking for IT professionals, type IT consultants and gain access to multi-niche groups.

Test and reach out to these groups and after they let you join, start commenting on existing conversations and previous posts. Do not post random comments and try to provide rich content and valuable information by focussing on making them informative, high-quality, and robust. 

People believe LinkedIn is a credible source of information and LinkedIn marketing strategy will help you grab leads in the industry. For instance, publish a thoughtful article on any latest trend and post the same content on Linkedln along with sharing it in relevant professional groups. This will give maximum and authentic exposure to your post.
